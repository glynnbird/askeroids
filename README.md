## Background

Back in the year 2000 I created a variant of the classic game Asteroids for a company I worked for called "Askeroids". I recently discovered the code and tried to "make" it and found, to my suprise, that it actually still worked. It is presented here for posterity. Java is required and preferably a Unix-like environment with "make".

## Compiling

Clone the repository and type:
```
  make
```

## Running

You can either serve out the compiled version on a website or from the command-line:

```
  ./run.sh
```

which launches the applet in Java's "appletviewer".
